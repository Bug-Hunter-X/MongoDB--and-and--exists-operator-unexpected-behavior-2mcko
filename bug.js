```javascript
const query = { $and: [ { "field1": { $exists: true } }, { "field2": { $exists: true } } ] };
//This query will return an empty array if either field1 or field2 are missing. However, it does not return an empty array if both fields are missing.
//If both field1 and field2 are missing, it returns all documents.
//The unexpected behavior is due to the way MongoDB handles $exists operator with $and. It will not return a document if any condition in the $and clause is not met.
